EECS 330: Town halls group project.
A proof of concept of a website for local discourse, with login capabilities, categorization and filtering functionality for news articles and discussion threads, and a form for submitting suggestions to the city government.
The goal of this site is to encourage discussion of local policy and encouraging city residents to become more involved in the creation and modification of said policies.
