			<div class="postHeadline">Should Northwestern Pay Property Tax?</div>
			<div class="ogPostSource">posted by Alvin Tan</div>
			<div class="ogPostTime">March 3rd, 2018</div>
			<div class="ogPostBody">Honestly, I don't understand why everyone complains so much about Northwestern University not paying property tax. I mean, it's not like NU even owns that much land! Like, the city of Evanston has so territory, the area that NU is on is negligable. Is Northwestern even part of Evanston? I think at this point, one could argue that it is actually Evanston that is part of Northwestern University. In fact, Evanston should start paying property tax to Northwestern! Yeah, I said it! Look, I know it's not a popular opinion, but I honestly believe that Evanston residents should just suck it up and deal with the fact that broke college students shouldn't have to pay property tax, plain and simple.</div>

				<div id="yourTextBody">Good grief you guys are so ingrateful! Evanston is what MAKES Northwestern such a great place to attend! The security around campus, the wide variety of foods, the general atmosphere of affluence -- Evanston makes the Northwestern experience! It's like the only good thing about going through this stressful ratrace they call higher education! And now NU has the AUDACITY to simply LEECH off of everything that Evanston has given it? That's inSANE! It's the LEAST Northwestern can do to pay property tax, given that it's taking up SO MUCH of Evanston land and that Evanston provides INVALUABLE SECURITY AND COMFORT to NU students!</div>

				Yeah! Honestly though! Evanston should really take some responsibility for their lack of good budgeting! I mean, if they wanted revenue from Northwestern students, they wouldn't let Whole Foods be the only local grocery store!
