			I think that Northwestern should pay property tax. 
			Based on the statistics from the "Should Northwestern Pay Property Tax?" article, 
			it would be more beneficial for the city if the university paid taxes.
			I have already written to city officials regarding this matter and I hope that 
			you will do the same.

			There are other sources out there that contradict your argument. According to 
			"Why Northwestern Should Not Pay Property Tax", Northwestern should not pay property tax.

			As a 20-year resident of Evanston, I think it's high time the university started paying 
			taxes. We residents shouldn't have to shoulder all of the burden.
