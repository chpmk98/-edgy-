  	  	<div class="postHeadline">Should Northwestern Pay Property Tax?</div>
  	  	<div class="postSource">posted by Alvin Tan</div>
  	  	<div class="postBody">Honestly, I don't understand why everyone complains so much about Northwestern University not paying property tax. I mean, it's not like NU even owns that much land! Like, the city of Evanston has so territory, the area that NU is on is negligable. Is Northwestern even part of Evanston? I think at this point, one could argue that it is actually Evanston that is part of Northwestern University. In fact, Evanston should start paying property tax to Northwestern! Yeah, I said it! Look, I know it's not a popular opinion, but I honestly believe that Evanston residents should just suck it up and deal with the fact that broke college students shouldn't have to pay property tax, plain and simple.</div>
